# Decision Tree Classifier Steps:

1. Define the Problem and Parameters
   
    Problem Definition

    Input Parameters: MATCH, REDUCE, LOWCVE, OTHER

    Output: Binary decision Tree for scanning (0 or 1)

    Feature Weights: 0.9 for the most significant feature, and 0.04, 0.03, 0.03 for the other features.

    Objective: Predict whether scanning should be done based on these parameters.

1. Data Preparation
   
    We'll create synthetic data using the provided feature weights to simulate their importance in the decision to scan or not.

1. Choose and Implement a Decision Tree Model
    Sample Code Using Decision Trees
    ```python
    
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
    
    # Seed for reproducibility
    np.random.seed(0)
    
    # Number of samples
    n_samples = 1000
    
    # Feature weights
    weights = [0.9, 0.04, 0.03, 0.03]
    features = ['MATCH', 'REDUCE', 'LOWCVE', 'OTHER']
    
    # Create synthetic data with weighted features
    data = {
        'MATCH': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'REDUCE': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'LOWCVE': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
        'OTHER': np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples),
    }
    
    # Calculate feature importance influence
    X = pd.DataFrame(data)
    X_weighted = X.apply(lambda x: x * weights, axis=1)
    
    # Simulate binary output based on feature weights
    # Weighted sum of features
    weighted_sum = X_weighted.sum(axis=1)
    # Binary output with probability of scanning influenced by the weighted sum
    probability_scan = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-weighted_sum))
    data['Scan'] = np.random.binomial(1, probability_scan)
    
    # Create DataFrame with target
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Define features and target variable
    X = df[['Match', 'REDUCE', 'LOWCVE', 'OTHER']]
    y = df['Scan']
    
    # Split the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    
    # Initialize and train the Decision Tree model
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Predict on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
    print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    
    # Display feature importance
    print("\nFeature Importances:")
    for feature, importance in zip(features, model.feature_importances_):
        print(f"{feature}: {importance:.4f}")
    ```
1. Model Evaluation
   
    Evaluate the model using:

    To check how the Decision Tree model has weighted each feature based on its contribution to the decision-making process.

1. Incorporate Feedback

    If feedback about manual scans is available, you can:

    Update the dataset with feedback information.

    Retrain the model incorporating this feedback if it affects the decision-making process.

1. Deploy and Monitor

    Deploy the model for real-time predictions and continuously monitor its performance. Update the model based on new data and feedback.

    Summary

    Data Preparation: Generate synthetic data with weighted features to reflect their importance.

    Model Implementation: Use a Decision Tree Classifier to model the decision process.

    Evaluation: Assess model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importances.
   
    Feedback Incorporation: Adjust the model as needed based on feedback.

    Deployment: Deploy and monitor the model.

    This approach ensures that you accurately reflect the given feature weights in the model and leverage the Decision Tree algorithm to make predictions based on these weighted features.
